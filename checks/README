Introduction
=====

This directory contains a number of checks which can be used with nagios/opsview. Most of these checks are for gathering metrics and plotting these.

stats/swift-access-stats
    This script processes access logs uploaded into Swift to generate a pickled state-file with counters for GET/PUT/DELETE http methods and their status codes.
    We run this every minute with cron.

stats/swift-account-stats
    This scripts processes account reports uploaded into Swift to generate some usage metrics (number of files / number of containers / space used)
    
check_swift.py
    This script does a functional check of Swift, trying to get an auth token, putting something, and then deleting something
    
check_swift_access
    This script reads the pickle-file produced by stats/swift-access-stats and returns the values to opsview for plotting    

check_swift_account
    This script reads the pickle-file produced by stats/swift-account-stats and returns the values to opsview for plotting

check_swift_async_pending
    This script returns number of async_pending objects. Can probably be replaced by a check that uses recon.

check_swift_io
    This script returns % disk utilization for disks in /srv/node

swift-stats.conf
    Configuration file for stats/* and check_swift.py
